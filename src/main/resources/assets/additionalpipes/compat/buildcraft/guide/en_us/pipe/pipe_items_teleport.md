Using a laser-charged microsingluarity contained through complex array of chipsets that create a magnetic field bottle, you have unlocked the secret of teleportation.
The Item Teleport Pipe instantly transports items to and from other pipes with the same frequency. If a teleport pipe has no valid outputs, it will drop its items on the ground.
Teleport Pipes also utilize advanced quantum plurifactor authentication based on the universal constant known only as the "UUID".  When set to Private mode, they can only be adjusted by you, and can only send or recieve items from pipes also placed by you and set to Private.
