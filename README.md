### Cloning and Compiling ###

    git clone https://github.com/tcooc/AdditionalPipesBC.git
    cd AdditionalPipesBC
    gradle setupDecompWorkspace
    gradle build
Compiled binaries can be found in `build/libs`.
    
### Setting Up Eclipse ###
1. Install Eclipse JDK.
2. Run the command `gradle setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies eclipse`
3. In Eclipse, go to `File > Import... > General > Existing Projects into Workspace`
4. Hit Next.  Click Browse... in the top right, and select the directory you cloned Additional Pipes into.  Check the box next to AdditionalPipesBC in the Projects list.
5. Hit Finish, and the mod project should be imported.
6. Set up the run configuration.  Go to `File > Import... > Run/Debug > Launch Configurations` and hit next.
7. Click the Browse... button and select the directory you cloned Additional Pipes into.  Check the box next to `AP Client 1.8.launch` in the right pane.
8. Hit finish.
9. Click the down arrow next to the play button on the top bar, select `Run Configurations...`, and click on AP Client 1.8 in the left pane.
10. Click on `AP Client 1.8` in the left pane and go to the arguments tab.
11. Replace `<username>` with your Mojang account email, and `<password>` with your Mojang account password
11.  Hit run.  If it works, you're done!
12.  If it doesn't, it's probably because your `.gradle` folder is not in your home directory, or you have unusual environment variables defined.  Either way, in the Arguments tab, replace `${env_var:userprofile}${env_var:HOME}/.gradle` with the full path to the folder containing your `.gradle` folder.

*Done!*

*Look ma, no LWJGL native library errors!*

Pipes still generally do the same thing. Some GUIs and recipes have changed (check NEI for recipes).

#### Experimental Pipes & Gate Features ####

##### Power Switch Pipe #####

Just a nifty little pipe with nice texture effects. Complete credits to ABO for the idea (the code is original though).

##### Closed Pipe #####

This pipe has 3 functions:

1. Acts like a normal pipe when transporting items.

2. Acts like a void pipe in that it never drops items.

3. Stores the items it "drops" inside an buffer. This buffer will destroy the oldest stack to make space for new stack when full.

Closed pipes also have a "closed" gate trigger which activates when the buffer has item(s) inside.

##### Water Pump Pipe #####

Just a pipe that fills with water if a source block is under it.
